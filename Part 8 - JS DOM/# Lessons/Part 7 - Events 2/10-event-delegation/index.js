  Event Delegation

// To handle the click event of each menu item, you may add the corresponding click event handlers:
// let home = document.querySelector('#home')
// home.addEventListener('home', (event) => {
//   console.log('Home menu item was clicked')
// })

// let dashboard = document.querySelector('#dashboard')
// dashboard.addEventListener('dashboard', (event) => {
//   console.log('Dashboard menu item was clicked')
// })

// let report = document.querySelector('#report')
// report.addEventListener('report', (event) => {
//   console.log('Report menu item was clicked')
// })
/*
  In JavaScript, if you have a large number of event handlers on a page, these event handlers will directly impact the performance because of the following reasons:

    - First, each event handler is a function which is also an object that takes up memory. The more objects in the memory, the slower the performance.
    - Second, it takes time to assign all the event handlers, which causes a delay in the interactivity of the page.

  To solve this issue, you can leverage the event bubbling.

//////////////////////////////////
// Instead of having multiple event handlers, you can assign a single event handler to handle all the click events:
let menu = document.querySelector('#menu')

menu.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  let target = event.target

  switch (target.id) {
    case 'home':
      console.log('Home menu item was clicked')
      break
    case 'dashboard':
      console.log('Dashboard menu item was clicked')
      break
    case 'report':
      console.log('Report menu item was clicked')
      break
  }
})
/*
  How it works.

      - When you click any <a> element inside the <ul> element with the id menu, the click event bubbles to the parent element which is the <ul> element. So instead of handling the click event of the individual <a> element, you can capture the click event at the parent element.
      - In the click event listener, you can access the target property which references the element that dispatches the event. To get the id of the element that the event actually fires, you use the target.id property.
      - Once having the id of the element that fires the click event, you can have code that handles the event correspondingly.

    The way that we handle the too-many-event-handlers problem is called the event delegation.

    The event delegation refers to the technique of levering event bubbling to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated.

  JavaScript event delegation benefits

    When it is possible, you can have a single event handler on the document that will handle all the events of a particular type. By doing this, you gain the following benefits:

      - Less memory usage, better performance.
      - Less time required to set up event handlers on the page.
      - The document object is available immediately. As long as the element is rendered, it can start functioning correctly without delay. You donâ€™t need to wait for the DOMContentLoaded or load events.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
  Summary

    - Having a large number of event handlers will take up memory and degrade the performance of a page.
    - The event delegation technique utilizes the event bubbling to handle event at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated.
