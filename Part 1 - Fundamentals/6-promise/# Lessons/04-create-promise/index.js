  Understanding JavaScript Promises
  - By definition, a promise is an object that encapsulates the result of an asynchronous operation.

  - A promise object has a state that can be one of the following:
    + Pending
    + Fulfilled with a value
    + Rejected for a reason

  - In the beginning, the state of a promise is pending, indicating that the asynchronous operation is in progress. Depending on the result of the asynchronous operation, the state changes to either fulfilled or rejected.

    + The fulfilled state indicates that the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.
    + The rejected state indicates that the asynchronous operation failed.


/////////////////////////////////

  Creating a promise
  - To create a promise object, you use the Promise() constructor:

      const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (success) {
          resolve(value);
        } else {
          reject(error);
        }
      });

  - The promise constructor accepts a callback function that typically performs an asynchronous operation. This function is often referred to as an executor.

  - In turn, the executor accepts two callback functions with the name resolve and reject.

    > If the asynchronous operation completes successfully, the executor will call the resolve() function to change the state of the promise from pending to fulfilled with a value.

    > In case of an error, the executor will call the reject() function to change the state of the promise from pending to rejected with the error reason.

  - Once a promise reaches either a fulfilled or rejected state, it stays in that state and canâ€™t go to another state.

  - In other words, a promise cannot go from the fulfilled state to the rejected state and vice versa. Also, it cannot go back from the fulfilled or rejected state to the pending state.

  - Once a new Promise object is created, its state is pending. If a promise reaches fulfilled or rejected state, it is resolved.

  @@ Note that you will rarely create promise objects in practice. Instead, you will consume promises provided by libraries.
