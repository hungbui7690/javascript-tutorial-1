/*
  Capturing groups
  - Suppose you have the following path:

        resource/id

  - For example:

        posts/10
        
  - In the path, the resource is posts and id is 10. To match the path, you use the following regular expression:

        /\w+\/\d+/

  - In this pattern:

    \w+ is a word character set with a quantifier (+) that matches one or more word characters.
    / matches the forward slash (/). The backslash (\) escapes the forward slash,
    \d+ is the combination of the digit character set and a quantifier (+), which matches one or more digits.

*/

// 1) The following uses the regular expression /\w+\/\d+/ pattern to match the string â€˜posts/10':
let path = 'posts/10'
let pattern = /\w+\/\d+/
let match = path.match(pattern)
console.log(match) // [ 'posts/10' ]

// To get the id 10 from the path posts/10, you use a capturing group. To create a capturing group for a rule, you place that rule in parentheses like this:
// (rule)
// The following example creates a capturing group that captures the id value from the path posts/10:
// '\w+/(\d+)'
pattern = /\w+\/(\d+)/
match = path.match(pattern)
console.log(match) // ['posts/10', '10']
/*
  The match() method returns an array of matches. The first element is the whole match ('posts/10') while the second one ('10') is the value of the capturing group.

  Note that the String.match() method will not return groups if you set the g flag e.g., /\w+\/(\d+)/g. If you use the g flag, you need to use the String.matchAll() method instead to get the groups.
*/

// 2) Multiple capturing groups
// To capture both the resource (posts) and id (10) of the path (post/10), you use multiple capturing groups in the regular expression as follows:
// /(\w+)\/(\d+)/
// The regex has two capturing groups one for \w+ and the other for \d+ .
// The following script shows the entire match and all the subgroups:
pattern = /(\w+)\/(\d+)/
match = path.match(pattern)
console.log(match) // ['posts/10', 'posts', '10']

// To access the first and second subgroups, you use match[1] and match[2]. Note that the match[0] returns the entire match. For example:
console.log(match[0], match[1], match[2])

// 3)
/*
  Named capturing groups

    To access a subgroup in a match, you use an index. However, you may want to access a subgroup by a meaningful name to make it more convenient.

    To do that, you use the named capturing group to assign a name to a group. The following shows the syntax for assigning a name to a capturing group:

      (?<name>rule)
      
    In this syntax:

      () indicates a capturing group.
      ?<name> specifies the name of the capturing group.
      rule is a rule in the pattern.

    For example, the following creates the names:

      /?<resource>\w+)\/(?<id>\d+/
  
    In this syntax:

      The resource is the name for the first capturing group
      The id is the name for the second capturing group.
*/
// For example:
pattern = /(?<resource>\w+)\/(?<id>\d+)/
match = path.match(pattern)
console.log(match) // [posts/10', 'posts', '10']

// The match has a groups property that is an object. The match.groups object has properties whose names are the capturing group name and values are the capturing values. For example:
pattern = /(?<resource>\w+)\/(?<id>\d+)/
match = path.match(pattern)
for (const name in match.groups) {
  console.log(name, match.groups[name])
}

// 4)
/*
  The following regular expression matches the path posts/2022/02/18

      /\w+\/d{4}\/d{2}\/d{2}/

  To capture the resource (post), year (2022), month (02), and day (18), you use the named capturing groups like this:

      /(?<resource>\w+)\/(?<year>\d{4})\/(?<month>\d{2})\/(?<day>\d{2})/

*/
// This program uses the patterns to match the path and shows all the subgroups:
path = 'posts/2022/02/18'
pattern = /(?<resource>\w+)\/(?<year>\d{4})\/(?<month>\d{2})\/(?<day>\d{2})/
match = path.match(pattern)
console.log(match.groups) // {resource: 'posts', year: '2022', month: '02', day: '18'}
