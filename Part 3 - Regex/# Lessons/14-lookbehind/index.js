/*
  Lookbehind
  - (?<=!Y)X matches X only if is is preceded by Y
  - (?<!Y)X matches X only if it is not preceded by Y


  - In regular expressions, a lookbehind matches an element if there is another specific element before it. A lookbehind has the following syntax:

      (?<=Y)X

  - In this syntax, the pattern match X if there is Y before it.

  - For example, suppose you want to match the number 900 not the number 1 in the following string:

      '1 computer costs $900'

  - To do it, you use a lookahead in the regular expression as follows:

      /(?<=\$)\d+/

  - In this regular expression:

      The (?<=\$) matches an element if there is a literal string $ before it. Because $ is a special character in the regex, we need to use the backslash \ to escape it. By doing this, the regex engine treats \$ as a literal character $.
      The \d+ matches one or more digits.

// 1) The following example illustrates how to use a lookbehind in a regular expression to match a number that has the $ sign before it:
let s = '1 computer costs $900'
let pattern = /(?<=\$)\d+/
let match = s.match(pattern)
console.log(match) // 900

// 2) Negative lookbehind
// To negate a lookbehind, you use a negative lookbehind with the following syntax:
// (?<!Y)X
// In this syntax, the regex engine matches X if there is no Y before it. The following example uses a regular expression with a negative lookbehind to match a number that doesnâ€™t have the $ letter before it:
s = '1 computer costs $900'
pattern = /(?<!\$)\d+/
match = s.match(pattern)
console.log(match) // 1
