  - The setTimeout() is a method of the window object. The setTimeout()  sets a timer and executes a callback function after the timer expires.

  - The following illustrates the syntax of setTimeout():

        let timeoutID  = setTimeout(cb [,delay], arg1, arg2,...);

  - In this syntax:

      + cb is a callback function to be executed after the timer expires.
      + delay is the time in milliseconds that the timer should wait before executing the callback function. If you omit it, the delay defaults to 0.
      + arg1, arg2, â€¦ are arguments passed to the cb callback function.

  - The setTimeout() returns a timeoutID which is a positive integer identifying the timer created as a result of calling the method.

  - The timeoutID can be used to cancel timeout by passing it to the clearTimeout() method.
*/

// When you click the Show button, the showAlert() is invoked and shows an alert dialog after 3 seconds. To cancel the timeout, you click the Cancel button.
let timeoutID

function showAlert() {
  timeoutID = setTimeout(alert, 3000, 'setTimeout Demo!')
}

function clearAlert() {
  clearTimeout(timeoutID)
}

  How JavaScript setTimeout() works

    JavaScript is single-threaded therefore it can only do one task at a time. It means that it can only carry a single task a given time. Besides the JavaScript engine, the web browser has other components such as Event Loop, Call Stack, and Web API.

    When you call the setTimeout(), the JavaScript engine creates a new function execution context and places it on the call stack.

    The setTimeout() executes and creates a timer in the Web APIs component of the web browser. When the timer expires, the callback function that was passed in the setTimeout() is placed to the callback queue.

    The event loop monitors both the call stack and the callback queue. It removes the callback function from the callback queue and places it to call stack when the call stack is empty.

    Once the callback function is on the call stack, it is executed.
*/
// See the following example:
function task() {
  console.log('setTimeout Demo!')
}

setTimeout(task, 3000)

/*
  In this example:

    First, the setTimeout() is placed on the call stack. It creates a timer on Web API. (pic)

    Second, after roughly 3 seconds, the timer expires, the task is pushed to the callback queue and waited for the next opportunity to execute.

    Third, because the call stack is empty, the event loop removes the task() from the callback queue, places it on the call stack, and executes it

    Fourth, the console.log() in the setTimeout() executes that creates a new function execution context.

    Finally, the console.log() and task() are popped out of the call stack once they are completed.
